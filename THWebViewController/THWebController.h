/**
 * @defgroup NimbusWebController Nimbus Web Controller
 * @{
 *
 * This controller presents a UIWebView with a toolbar containing basic chrome for interacting
 * with it. The chrome shows forward, back, stop and refresh buttons on a toolbar aligned
 * to the bottom of the view controller's view. The toolbar includes an option to open the
 * URL in Safari. If the controller is shown in a navigation controller, self.title will
 * show the current web page's title. A spinner will be shown in the navigation bar's right
 * bar button area if there are any active requests.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Adding the Web Controller to Your Application</h2>
 *
 * The web controller uses a small number of custom icons that are stored in the
 * NimbusWebController bundle. You must add this bundle to your application, ensuring
 * that you select the "Create Folder References" option and that the bundle is
 * copied in the "Copy Bundle Resources" phase.
 *
 * The bundle can be found at <code>src/webcontroller/resources/NimbusWebController.bundle</code>.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Future Goals</h2>
 *
 * - Better use of screen real estate on the iPad. We will ideally provide multiple implementation
 *   styles. For example: native Safari, with the toolbar at the top; native Twitter, with the
 *   toolbar at the bottom; plain, with no toolbar at all.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Example Applications</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Basic Web Controller</h3>
 *
 * <a
 * href="https://github.com/jverkoey/nimbus/tree/master/examples/webcontroller/BasicWebController">
 * View the README on GitHub</a>
 *
 * This sample application demos the use of the web controller on the iPhone and iPad.
 *
 * <h2>Screenshots</h2>

/**
 * A simple web view controller implementation with a toolbar.
 *
 *      @ingroup NimbusWebController
 *
 *
 * <h2>Subclassing</h2>
 *
 * This view controller implements UIWebViewDelegate. If you want to
 * implement methods of this delegate then you should take care to call the super implementation
 * if necessary. The following UIViewWebDelegate methods have implementations in this class:
 *
 * @code
 * - webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:
 * - webViewDidStartLoad:
 * - webViewDidFinishLoad:
 * - webView:didFailLoadWithError:
 * @endcode
 *
 * This view controller also implements UIActionSheetDelegate. If you want to implement methods of
 * this delegate then you should take care to call the super implementation if necessary. The
 * following UIActionSheetDelegate methods have implementations in this class:
 *
 * @code
 * - actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:
 * - actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex:
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition to the above methods of the UIActionSheetDelegate, this view controller also provides
 * the following method, which is invoked prior to presenting the internal action sheet to the user
 * and allows subclasses to customize the action sheet or even reject to display it (and provide their
 * own handling instead):
 *
 * @code
 * - shouldPresentActionSheet:
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h2>Recommended Configurations</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Default</h3>
 *
 * The default settings will create a toolbar with the default tint color, which is normally
 * light blue on the iPhone and gray on the iPad.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Colored Toolbar</h3>
 *
 * The following settings will change the toolbar tint color (in this case black)
 *
 * @code
 *  [webController setToolbarTintColor:[UIColor blackColor]];
 * @endcode
